## Development Commands

```bash
# Navigate to React Native app
cd react-native-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run on iOS simulator (requires macOS)
npm run ios

# Run on Android emulator
npm run android

# Run in web browser for testing
npm run web
```

## Testing Options

### 1. Expo Go App (Recommended for Quick Testing)
- Install Expo Go from App Store/Google Play
- Scan QR code from `npm start` command
- Test on your physical device instantly
- Hot reload for rapid development

### 2. iOS Simulator (macOS Required)
```bash
npm run ios
```
- Full iOS experience with native features
- Debug with React Native Developer Tools
- Test iOS-specific functionality

### 3. Android Emulator
```bash
npm run android
```
- Test Android-specific features
- Available on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Full Android device simulation

### 4. Web Browser Testing
```bash
npm run web
```
- Quick testing of UI and logic
- Not all React Native features work in web
- Good for rapid prototyping

## Deployment Options

### 1. Expo Application Services (EAS)
**For App Store/Google Play deployment**:
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g @expo/cli

# Configure for deployment
eas build:configure

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android

# Submit to app stores
eas submit
```

### 2. Development Builds
**For testing with team**:
```bash
# Create development build
eas build --profile development

# Share with testers via Expo
eas build:list
```

### 3. Expo Updates (OTA)
**For quick updates without app store approval**:
```bash
# Publish update
eas update --branch production
```

## Data Integration

The React Native app currently uses mock data. To integrate with your existing backend:

1. **API Integration**: Replace mock data with calls to your Express server
2. **React Query**: Already configured for server state management
3. **Authentication**: Integrate with your existing user system
4. **Database Sync**: Connect to your PostgreSQL database via API

## Next Steps

1. **Install Expo CLI**: `npm install -g @expo/cli`
2. **Test on Device**: Use Expo Go app for immediate testing
3. **Customize Styling**: Modify colors and themes in component files
4. **Add Real Data**: Integrate with your existing API endpoints
5. **Deploy**: Use EAS Build for app store deployment

Your React Native Expo app provides a professional, native mobile experience for co-parenting coordination with all the features from your web application optimized for mobile devices.
