Your CoParent Connect app has been converted to React Native Expo with a working demo version ready for immediate testing.

## Quick Start (2 Minutes)

1. **Download Expo Go** from App Store or Google Play
2. **Scan QR Code** (coming next when I start the server)
3. **Test immediately** on your actual device

### Option 2: Test on Computer
1. **Web browser testing** (limited mobile features)
2. **iOS/Android simulator** (requires setup)

## Testing Workflow

1. **Install Expo Go** on your phone
2. **Scan QR code** from development server
3. **Test calendar** - tap dates and assign them
4. **Test tasks** - mark items complete/incomplete
5. **Switch tabs** - navigate between features
6. **Test touch interactions** - all buttons and gestures

## Real Co-Parenting Features

The demo includes realistic scenarios:
- **June calendar** with some pre-assigned dates
- **Family tasks** assigned to different members
- **Color system** that clearly shows responsibilities
- **Touch-optimized** interface for mobile use

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you've tested the demo and confirmed it works:
1. **Integrate with your backend** - replace demo data with real API calls
2. **Add authentication** - connect to your user system
3. **Enhance features** - add notifications, permissions, etc.
4. **Deploy to app stores** - use Expo's build service

Your React Native Expo app provides a professional mobile experience that's much easier to develop and test than traditional native development.
