## Testing Workflow

1. **Development**: Use Expo Go for instant testing
2. **Staging**: Create development builds for team testing
3. **Production**: Use EAS Build for app store submission

## Integration with Existing Backend

The React Native app is designed to integrate with your existing Express/PostgreSQL backend:

1. Replace mock data in screens with API calls
2. Use existing authentication system
3. Connect to your database via the REST API
4. Maintain feature parity with web version

## Next Steps

1. Run `npx expo start` in the react-native-app directory
2. Test core functionality using Expo Go
3. Customize styling and branding as needed
4. Integrate with your existing API endpoints
5. Deploy to app stores using EAS Build

Your React Native Expo app provides a professional, native mobile experience that's easier to develop and deploy than traditional native apps while maintaining full performance and platform integration.
